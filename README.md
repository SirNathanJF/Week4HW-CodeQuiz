## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

## My experience

```
To be completely honest, this homework was horrible. Everything I did caused a new error, and I spent an horrendous amount of time trying to learn JavaScript at this level. It just felt like I couldn't quite execute what I wanted. I never got the leaderboard working correctly, it wont show a highscore on submit. While it does save the values in local storage it does not populate immediately and I could not figure out how to change that. One needs to refresh the page and click on the highscores link in order to get that to work. I learned a lot and gathered a lot of resources I can use to further my knowledge of JavaScript. Also I learned a lot about repos and finally figured out that my commits are not good. I could have reverted multiple times if I screwed one thing up as opposed to starting the JavaSript fresh.
